# node-webkit wrapper for app

Wrapper application for node-webkit instances that run in the San Diego Natural History Museum's [Coast to 
Cactus exhibit](http://www.sdnhm.org/exhibitions/current-exhibitions/coast-to-cactus-in-southern-california/).

## Disclaimer
This code is offered here for example and reference. The compiled application is not intended for public consumption outside of the exhibit. This repository is lacking the media files that make up the full application.

## Technical notes
This is a pretty basic wrapper featuring some full screen kiosk settings and a custom logo for the application. We only use node-webkit in some places in the exhibit. [Stele](https://github.com/scimusmn/stele) has proven a more stable approach.
